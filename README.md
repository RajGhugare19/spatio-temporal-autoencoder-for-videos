# spatio-temporal-autoencoder-for-videos

Currently this code is tailored specifically for [UCSDped1](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/projects/anomaly/dataset.html) 

Steps to get this working
1) Create a folder `data`. Create two subfolders `train` and `val`
2) Create a folder `saved_models`
3) Store the downloaded dataset folder named UCSDped1 in the same directory.
